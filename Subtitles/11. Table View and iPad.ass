Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.45,0:13:41.90,yin,,0,0,0,,如何对触碰作出响应 诸如此类\N{\fs12}and how is it reacting to touches and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:41.90,0:13:47.10,yin,,0,0,0,,这两种我都会讲到 数据源和委托\N{\fs12}So we're going to talk about both of these delegates -- the datasource and the delegate.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:47.10,0:13:51.06,yin,,0,0,0,,UITableViewController 我讲清楚一些\N{\fs12}The UI TableView Controller, just to be clear --
Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.06,0:13:52.54,yin,,0,0,0,,前几张幻灯片中我讲过\N{\fs12}I showed this a couple slides ago --
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.54,0:13:55.91,yin,,0,0,0,,它会自动关联到数据源和委托\N{\fs12}it automatically wires itself up as the datasource and delegate.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:55.91,0:13:59.30,yin,,0,0,0,,如果你要使用一个通用视图控制器\N{\fs12}If you were going to bring out a generic view controller and drag

Dialogue: 0,0:14:01.65,0:14:04.73,yin,,0,0,0,,这时你就需要自己动手将数据源和委托\N{\fs12}You would have to control drag the datasource and the delegate
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.73,0:14:07.49,yin,,0,0,0,,Control拖动拖到你的试图控制器并关联起来\N{\fs12}to your view controller yourself. You'd have to hook them up.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:07.49,0:14:10.39,yin,,0,0,0,,或者在代码中关联 反正是要关联起来\N{\fs12}Or in code you could hook them up too. But you have to connect them up.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.39,0:14:13.50,yin,,0,0,0,,而UITableViewController会自动关联起来\N{\fs12}But UI TableView controller automatically hooks it up.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.50,0:14:16.95,yin,,0,0,0,,数据源和委托几乎总是你的控制器\N{\fs12}The datasource and delegate are almost always going to be your controller.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:16.95,0:14:20.13,yin,,0,0,0,,这很显然 应为控制器的工作就是\N{\fs12}That just makes sense because the controller's job is
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.13,0:14:22.53,yin,,0,0,0,,为视图解释模型的信息\N{\fs12}to interpret the information of the model for the view.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.53,0:14:25.71,yin,,0,0,0,,很显然 控制器希望是委托\N{\fs12}So obviously the controller wants to be the delegate.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:25.71,0:14:29.05,yin,,0,0,0,,回到我们第一天讲的MVC\N{\fs12}And again, back to the MVC thing that we did the very first day,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.05,0:14:34.21,yin,,0,0,0,,这是视图和控制器之间一种盲的 结构化的通信\N{\fs12}this is that blind, structured communication between the view and the controller.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.21,0:14:37.95,yin,,0,0,0,,UITableViewController还有一个属性\N{\fs12}The UI TableView Controller also has a property
Dialogue: 0,0:14:37.95,0:14:41.88,yin,,0,0,0,,叫tableView 让你能够得到控制器中的TableView\N{\fs12}called TableView which lets you get the TableView that's in your controller.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:41.88,0:14:44.12,yin,,0,0,0,,这很好 这样你就能对它进行配置\N{\fs12}So that's nice to be able to do that so you can configure it
Dialogue: 0,0:14:44.12,0:14:45.61,yin,,0,0,0,,同它通信等等\N{\fs12}and talk to it and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.61,0:14:47.15,yin,,0,0,0,,这很棒\N{\fs12}So that's a nice one.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.15,0:14:49.28,yin,,0,0,0,,它其实是self.view\N{\fs12}It actually happens to be self.view
Dialogue: 0,0:14:49.28,0:14:51.81,yin,,0,0,0,,在TableViewController中 这有些奇特\N{\fs12}in a TableView controller which is a little weird.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.81,0:14:56.49,yin,,0,0,0,,我认为这是苹果方面的奇怪设计 总之 它就是这样了\N{\fs12}That was a strange design choice I think on Apple's part, but it is what it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:56.49,0:15:00.24,yin,,0,0,0,,好 数据源协议中有哪些重要的方法呢\N{\fs12}Okay. So what are the important methods in this datasource protocol?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.24,0:15:02.24,yin,,0,0,0,,重要的有三个\N{\fs12}Well, there's really three important ones.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:02.24,0:15:05.16,yin,,0,0,0,,一是 表格中有多少个section\N{\fs12}One is, how many sections are in this table?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.16,0:15:07.10,yin,,0,0,0,,每一个section中有多少行\N{\fs12}How many rows are in each section?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:07.10,0:15:10.38,yin,,0,0,0,,然后给我一个视图 一个UITableViewCell\N{\fs12}And then give me a view -- a UI TableView cell --

Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.52,0:15:16.29,yin,,0,0,0,,很显然 就这三个方法\N{\fs12}Obvious, right? These are the three things.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.29,0:15:18.57,yin,,0,0,0,,知道有多少数据 然后\N{\fs12}Know how much data there is, and then it just asks --
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.57,0:15:21.19,yin,,0,0,0,,持续通过这些来请求数据\N{\fs12}constantly asks you for the data by asking for these --
Dialogue: 0,0:15:21.19,0:15:21.89,yin,,0,0,0,,这个视图\N{\fs12}this view.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:21.89,0:15:24.08,yin,,0,0,0,,这个UITableViewCell 不断往复\N{\fs12}This UI TableView cell over and over.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.08,0:15:26.42,yin,,0,0,0,,我们先讲最后一个 因为这个最重要\N{\fs12}So let's cover the last one first, because that's the most important.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.42,0:15:29.44,yin,,0,0,0,,section数和行数很简单 只是请求一个数字\N{\fs12}It's really easy; the sections and rows, it's just asking you for a number.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:29.44,0:15:33.22,yin,,0,0,0,,但为每一行获得单元格就难一些了\N{\fs12}But the -- getting the cell for each row is a little more complicated,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:33.22,0:15:34.37,yin,,0,0,0,,我们先来看这个\N{\fs12}so let's talk about that one first.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.37,0:15:38.91,yin,,0,0,0,,这是数据源协议中的第三个方法\N{\fs12}So this is the third method in the datasource protocol.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:38.91,0:15:44.28,yin,,0,0,0,,方法名叫 TableView cellForRowAtIndexPath\N{\fs12}And it's called, "TableView Cell for Row and Index Path".
Dialogue: 0,0:15:44.28,0:15:47.56,yin,,0,0,0,,你应该能预计到它会叫这个\N{\fs12}It's kind of exactly what you'd expect it to be called,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.56,0:15:51.14,yin,,0,0,0,,可以理解 indexPath(索引路径)是一个对象\N{\fs12}in the sense, once you understand that index path is just an object
Dialogue: 0,0:15:51.14,0:15:54.50,yin,,0,0,0,,描述section和section中的行\N{\fs12}that describes the section and row within that section.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.50,0:15:55.70,yin,,0,0,0,,indexPath是一个对象\N{\fs12}So index path is an object.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:55.70,0:15:58.28,yin,,0,0,0,,它有两个属性 row和section\N{\fs12}It has two properties; row and section.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:58.28,0:16:01.86,yin,,0,0,0,,这个参数相当于是将行和section封装到了\N{\fs12}So that argument is basically just encapsulating the
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.86,0:16:03.97,yin,,0,0,0,,一个对象之中\N{\fs12}row and section into one object.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.76,0:16:08.05,yin,,0,0,0,,我们被要求提供一个单元格\N{\fs12}So that -- so we're being asked here to provide a cell --

Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.39,0:16:16.71,yin,,0,0,0,,我们只对动态表格这样做\N{\fs12}And we only do this for dynamic tables.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:16.71,0:16:18.81,yin,,0,0,0,,因为对于静态表格\N{\fs12}Because for a static table we set all this
Dialogue: 0,0:16:18.81,0:16:20.89,yin,,0,0,0,,所有这些都在故事板中设置\N{\fs12}up in the storyboard, so we don't need --
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.89,0:16:23.69,yin,,0,0,0,,TableView不需要问我们要这个视图\N{\fs12}you know, there's no need for the TableView to be asking us
Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.69,0:16:25.70,yin,,0,0,0,,因为故事板中已经设定好了\N{\fs12}for this view, because it's already set up in the storyboard.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:25.70,0:16:28.38,yin,,0,0,0,,只有动态表格中才有这些\N{\fs12}This is only for dynamic ones that we have this.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.38,0:16:32.03,yin,,0,0,0,,这里我们需要做哪两件事呢\N{\fs12}And what are the two things that we need to do in here?

Dialogue: 0,0:16:34.32,0:16:36.49,yin,,0,0,0,,然后 我们需要对单元格进行配置\N{\fs12}And then we need to configure that cell.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.49,0:16:38.62,yin,,0,0,0,,我们将单独谈到这两点\N{\fs12}So we're going to talk about those two things separately.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:38.62,0:16:41.28,yin,,0,0,0,,首先 如何创建一个我们要返回的单元格呢\N{\fs12}First of all, how do we create a cell that we're going to return?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:41.28,0:16:43.99,yin,,0,0,0,,因为我们需要返回一个单元格 UITableViewCell\N{\fs12}Because we have to return a cell here -- UI TableView cell.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:43.99,0:16:47.42,yin,,0,0,0,,这里需要用到一个很特别的函数\N{\fs12}And we do that using this kind of funky method called,

Dialogue: 0,0:16:52.14,0:16:57.47,yin,,0,0,0,,它的作用是回到故事板\N{\fs12}Okay now, what this does is it essentially goes and looks in the storyboard.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:57.47,0:16:59.93,yin,,0,0,0,,找到标识符 Flickr Photo Cell\N{\fs12}Finds that identifier -- Flickr Photo Cell --
Dialogue: 0,0:16:59.93,0:17:03.04,yin,,0,0,0,,我说过 这在故事板中很重要 记得吧\N{\fs12}remember I told you that was an important thing to type in, in the storyboard.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:07.85,0:17:10.03,yin,,0,0,0,,并返回它\N{\fs12}And returns it.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:10.03,0:17:13.27,yin,,0,0,0,,不过 它的作用要比这更复杂一些\N{\fs12}However, it's a little more sophisticated than that,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:13.27,0:17:20.09,yin,,0,0,0,,dequeueReusableCell(出列可再用单元格)是说 它只创建\N{\fs12}and the reason it's called dequeue Reusable Cell, is that it only creates those things

Dialogue: 0,1:00:02.38,1:00:05.45,yin,,0,0,0,,我们需要使用valueForKeyPath方法\N{\fs12}we have to use this value for key path method
Dialogue: 0,1:00:05.45,1:00:07.62,yin,,0,0,0,,而不是使用objectForKey\N{\fs12}instead of using object for key, right?
Dialogue: 0,1:00:07.62,1:00:10.04,yin,,0,0,0,,像常规字典方法中那样\N{\fs12}Which would be a normal dictionary method.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:10.04,1:00:12.38,yin,,0,0,0,,我打算这样做\N{\fs12}So I'm going to do that.

Dialogue: 0,1:01:17.90,1:01:24.04,yin,,0,0,0,,这将=nil\N{\fs12}So this is -- and I -- this would be =nil.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:24.04,1:01:28.58,yin,,0,0,0,,但&error是指向这个指针的一个指针\N{\fs12}But an ampersand error is a pointer to this pointer.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:28.58,1:01:33.30,yin,,0,0,0,,那就是null\N{\fs12}So that would be null.
