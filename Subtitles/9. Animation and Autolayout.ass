Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.44,0:01:00.26,yin,,0,0,0,,为什么最后不飞出去呢\N{\fs12}And so why weren't they flying off at the end?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.26,0:01:02.47,yin,,0,0,0,,部分是因为\N{\fs12}Well, part of the reason they weren't flying off was
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.47,0:01:06.30,yin,,0,0,0,,方块搭成的塔太不稳了\N{\fs12}because they were, those towers of blocks were so tippy,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.56,0:04:42.34,yin,,0,0,0,,只不过它是在指定属性\N{\fs12}They just specify attributes instead of, you know,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.34,0:04:44.47,yin,,0,0,0,,而不是应用作用力等\N{\fs12}applying the forces or whatever,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.48,0:04:47.47,yin,,0,0,0,,但其实你也可以把它们看做是在应用作用力\N{\fs12}but you can actually think of them somewhat as applying forces too,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.22,0:04:51.17,yin,,0,0,0,,比如 用作用力阻止物体旋转\N{\fs12}it's just, you know, like forces to keep them from rotating
